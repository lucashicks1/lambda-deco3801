# Week 5 Project Snapshot 
## Contents & Outline

Hi Rosti, welcome to our Week 5 Project Snapshot :) Here is just a rough outline & description of the key items included in the zip file we're submitting, so that you don't have to figure out what everything is on your own. Hope this helps!

---

***Please note:** a significant part of our progress in recent weeks has been related to setting up our version control & code collaboration ecosystem within our GitHub repo, as well as incorporating our project roadmap, milestones, and team member responsibilities into this ecosystem. Hopefully you should have access to both our [repo](https://github.com/lucashicks1/lambda-deco3801) as well as the associated [project](https://github.com/users/lucashicks1/projects/1) (which is where we've stored timeline information, task assignees, etc.), and can check in on the issues we've made so far and task lists contained in each of those!* 

**Note:** directories and sub-directories are included as numbered list items with plaintext formatting, whereas the actual files in these directories are included as bullet point list items with `this formatting`. Star emojis ⭐️ indicate files that are of note/contain key changes or project developments. 

1. build
	- `README.md` — placeholder for the README file detailing physical build components, currently empty
2. build-documentation 
	- ⭐️ `Engineering Specifications.docx` — technical specifications, project hardware specifications, schematics conventions & expected code style guides for languages to be used throughout project 
	- `README.md` — placeholder for the README file containing physical build documentation, currently empty
3. meeting-vault
	1. General
		1. Meetings 
			- ⭐️ `General.M01.md` & `General.M02.md` — meeting minutes from our general meetings. *Please note these are not the only meetings we have held; minutes like these are produced only for "general" meetings in which we discuss agenda items, plan for future technical work, and so on. We have not developed formal minutes during studios or  other meetings with a technical/development/prototyping focus as we have found that these types of sessions are more productive if we approach them as co-working workshops rather than "meetings" per se. Verbally recapping progress made & assigning the resulting tasks to each person at the end of these sessions has been sufficient thus far, although we plan to introduce a more concrete "recap" documentation process from now. 
			- ⭐️ `DECO3801 Gantt Chart – Full Timeline Draft.pdf` — static PDF copy of the Miro board timeline draft we developed, as in our Statement of Work submission. We are in the process of transitioning to our Github project roadmap instead of this timeline, but this document is still useful as an initial point of reference. 
		- `General.md`  — a Markdown file with list of & links to all general meeting minutes contained in the vault
	1. Images
		- ⭐️ `mermaid-diagram-2023-08-23-221934.png` — static screenshot of the rendered `Flow Chart.md` file
	2. Project Brief Ideation
		- *Several PDFs of key research papers & design frameworks we used to conduct exploratory user & market research — write ups & insights collation is currently in progress for these*
		- ⭐️ `Annotated Project Brief.pdf` — a copy of our assigned project brief alongside early annotations we made in the process of breaking down the specification. Not all of these annotations no longer reflect our approach, but we are including them as they demonstrate the evolution of our thinking.
		- ⭐️ `Brief Breakdown Canvas.canvas` — an Obsidian canvas containing collated notes, insights, & documentation that we produced throughout the process of breaking down the specification and developing our approach to the project. If you're not able to render this canvas file (it might be Obsidian only) we've also included a static screenshot of it in the `Brief Breakdown Screenshot.png` file. 
		- ⭐️ `Lucas Brainstorm.md` — a Markdown file containing Lucas, David, & Dylan's initial work on possible features of & ways to approach the calendar data storage component of the project.
	- ⭐️ `Flow Chart.md` — a Markdown language flowchart capturing the planned components of & relationships between the different sections of our project at a high level. 
4. notes-resources
	- *Several PDFs of other key research papers we are currently exploring as part of our continued research*
	- *A copy of our original project brief & our submitted project preferences form*
5. project-sketches
	1. Physical-Engineering-Drawings
		- ⭐️ `ServoCircuit.pdf` — draft diagram of the circuit to be used for our platform servomotors
		- ⭐️ `USB_CamLink.pdf` — draft diagram of the circuit to be used for our USB camera link  
	- ⭐️ `Physical Components Map – Current Working Version.pdf` — a sketch illustrating the components we currently envision as comprising our project, as well as justifications/details associated with each of these and mappings for the relationships between them
	- ⭐️ `Physical Components Map – Early Draft with Proposed Revisions.pdf` — a sketch illustrating a simpler, earlier version of our envisioned project's components, as well as notes detailing a key concern and proposed changes that we ultimately decided to move forward with 
-  `README.md` — placeholder for the codebase-wide documentation, currently no changes made to default GitHub template
