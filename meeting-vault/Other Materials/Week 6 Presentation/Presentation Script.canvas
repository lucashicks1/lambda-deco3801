		{"type":"text","text":">[!tip] A brief introduction to your team and your project\n>\n> 30 seconds\n\n\n- Hi everyone, my name's Ali and I'm presenting on behalf of team \\lambda, which is also made up by Lucas, Alex, Maya, David, and Dylan. We are working on Project 14, the \"Social Family\". \n- This essentially tasks us with designing an ambient interface to support a family through time management and event planning activities in a way that's more collaborative and actually facilitates social engagement in the way that you'd want to see from a close-knit family taking a shared moment to schedule time together/with each other. \n So, the brief identifies this problem with existing time management solutions in that while they can be very effective, they're often concerned more with the pure efficiency of making plans, rather than the opportunity that process provides for family engagement *as you make those plans*\n- That's especially true of the mobile applications that you see really commonly in this space, where by being constantly available anywhere anytime, they can actually become overly demanding, they can be isolating since you're often gonna be checking them all by yourself, and of course they're designed for managing schedules of all kinds, not just for time with your loved ones, so commonly they're gonna fragment people's focus across the different calendars that make up different parts of their lives, rather than facilitating this \"harmonious social family experience\". \n- As an example, picture a family of four using something like Google Calendar to find the best time to go see Barbie. You could be literally anywhere, you open your phone, you see Friday night's the only time everyone's got space, so you add a new event in the calendar, and it's all booked. Super efficient, sure, but it's so impersonal — you don't have to consult everybody else, you don't even have to be around them as you do it, you guys might not even talk about it again until that Friday, like, you've lost this moment to come together as a family and connect with each other about seeing a movie you're all excited for. Not to mention, you know, now the person who actually chose Friday night kind of becomes implicitly responsible for their choice – so, if anything goes wrong it's a bit on them, like you know maybe if you'd have spoken to your brother first he'd have warned you never to go to Event Cinemas on a Friday night because it's packed and now you feel bad about that – *and* there's also this unspoken demand that everybody else successfully keeps up with anything and everything that might have been added to this calendar at any time, even if they were literally never consulted about those additions. \n- So, you know, they might efficiently enable you to do this co-planning, but it's hardly a collaborative process, and maybe that event itself is a nice shared family moment but you often lose the other shared family moments that you could have enjoyed throughout the process of planning that event alongside each other. Sort of feels like managing a bunch of coworkers you don't know very well, not making plans with your close family.

		{"type":"text","text":">[!tip] Developments so far – in our ethics, security, and data privacy considerations, as well as to our initial work plan\n> \n> 1 minute \n\n\nOur ethics and data privacy considerations have really been concerned with respecting individual family members' right to privacy even throughout this process of collaborating on time management, so we've consistently tried to ensure that our system design doesn't require anybody to disclose details of their own schedule to the rest of the family unless they choose to — only very course-grained data is needed for the ecosystem to function as intended. Because we are storing data about family members' personal schedules, there is potentially somewhat sensitive information there, particularly because 1. although it's course-grained, it might still be enough  to infer a person's location or routine, and 2. since it's a family context, it's more than likely at least some of the users will also be minors. For that reason, a major consideration for us is that we adequately de-identify any data as much as possible before storing it in our database. We do feel quite satisfied that we've mitigated a lot of the major security risks by keeping communication implemented locally rather than via servers or other networked applications, which is feasible us because we are working under that location-dependent design paradigm, but that said, we are aware that scaling this product out to work for a larger location like a corporate environment would introduce additional security risks. \nMost of those are things we flagged as concerns early on and have just been keeping in mind as we go, but there has been one major development recently concerning data privacy and associated security, which was our realisation that just because we design for a given household doesn't mean those are necessarily going to be the only people physically in that house ever, which does exacerbate some of the risks that come up based on the presence of sensitive information I mentioned before. With that in mind, we're currently in the process of conducting user interviews to determine the level of access control that people feel is necessary – for example, if somebody brings a new friend over for dinner, should the display shut off entirely? Should it just temporarily conceal minors' information? Or is that not something that concerns users? So, that's something we recently identified as a potential risk and are now in the process of working with users to mitigate.\n\nAs far as how we are tracking against our work plan, we are really happy with our communication strategy and meeting timeline, those have been working well for us and we've been able to keep to our original timeline fairly successfully. A few major developments though include that we've pushed the build start back somewhat to allow more time for user research and actually involving potential users in our prototyping process first, just to really make sure that our idea actually does solve the problem that it says it does; so, that has meant we spent a few additional meetings on really comprehensively setting out the fine details of our system design and refining each component before we jumped into any actual development, and in particular taking more time for low-fidelity prototyping of our front end display to make sure our visual communication there genuinely resonates with people and affords them the insights they're actually looking for out of it. We also realised that with several very different interconnected components in development at once, we needed to allocate more time for cross-team collaboration where we check in with each other and make sure that everything we're doing is compatible, so that was a bit of a timeline adjustment as well. I think we're now really happy with our planned next steps and milestones, so ","id":"d4d7828c676e4784","x":960,"y":210,"width":600,"height":1550,"color":"4"},
		{"type":"text","text":">[!tip] What your team will be doing over the remaining weeks to achieve your project build goals\n> \n> 30 seconds\n\njust to illustrate what we'll be doing over the remaining time, this is the roadmap that we've built up in GitHub that will hopefully take us through to our project build goals. So, you can see that we aim to finish up with that exploratory research phase in the near future, although we will keep testing with users throughout, and then the next few weeks we'll be tackling the disparate components in parallel, and then finally from about Week 10 we'll progressively start integrating each of these and testing that integration, so first with only a few deliverables at a time and then finally with the whole project ecosystem all together. In terms of how our team skills are sort of distributed throughout this process, we'll have Dylan leading our physical computing side; Alex leading our computer vision component; David and Lucas leading the database and inter-component communication; and Maya leading our front end development, with me handling the broader project management and scrum mastery, and then each of us are also supporting across 1-3 other sub-teams according to our strengths,","id":"600083d83bb988be","x":1680,"y":-139,"width":600,"height":659,"color":"3"},

		{"type":"text","text":">[!tip] What you have designed and developed so far – high level description of our project idea and how it addresses the problem space, with sources we used as a foundation\n> \n>  1 minute 30 seconds \n\n- So, the way we envision solving that problem is by sort of building tools to support this time management process from within the home, in a way that draws on the existing flow of a house, like the natural pathways through and gathering places in a family home. Within that, there's kind of two key components – we need to get calendar data in somehow; and we then need to get meaningful insights out of it, so we can visualise those in a helpful way. \n- For the first part, there are two distinct types of info we need to collect: each family member's individual availability, so like times when they are and aren't free for a potential family event, as well as the actual planned family events once they've been talked about and pencilled in, so, times that the whole family has then agreed to commit to. We really wanna make sure our product fits really naturally into the existing workflows in and around a home, so the way we're handling this part is using physical whiteboard calendars that we set up in key spaces, with associated cameras & motion detection that determine when changes have been made to the calendar and capture those changes. To get everybody's individual availability, they each get their own whiteboard to install in the existing workspace or personal area that works best for them, and then for the calendar that holds the shared events that the family are gonna be planning together, that goes on a communal surface in a key sort of \"hub\" zone at the heart of the house – we've been talking about that as like a whiteboard on the kitchen fridge, so in a place where people are already regularly moving through and participating in, the idea being that it's accessible for every single family member to be equally involved in managing that calendar, and incredibly easy for everybody to be conscious of any changes that get made to it. \n\nFor both the inputs and outputs to the system, our hope is that by integrating this into a home rather than providing it as a mobile solution, people are sort of exclusively interacting with this calendar when they're in the right physical *and* mental space to do so – like, in your bedroom on your own time, the only calendar you're concerned with is *yours*, whereas when you're in the kitchen or dining room and you're already chatting with family, hearing about their days or sharing about yours, maybe you're better equipped at that time and that space to actively be part of conversations about how you guys would like to spend time together next. This is an approach that was really informed by [insert stuff about location-dependent design].","id":"7abafc139fca99fa","x":100,"y":380,"width":760,"height":1260,"color":"6"},
