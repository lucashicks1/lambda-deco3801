- Could be like Fakin It
- Collaborative game
- AI involved - FSM
- Training, education, research and stimulation - based on health and safety stuff
- 1. Prepare phase: hidden list of objectives to complete by also avoid other hazards which the villain player is trying to inject
- 2. Defend phase: AI tests safety measures

### 14 Ambient Interfaces - The Social Family
Interest: 5
Qualified: 5
Feasibility: 5 !!!!!

- Ambient technology - not intrusive
- Backend/Frontend + Physical Building

### 11 Aphasia AI Reading Support:
Interest: 2
Qualified: 2
Feasibility: 2\~3

- LLM + Interface
- Not much wiggle room - clear end/result
- Big Focus on LLM - very subject
- Lots of data needed to train the LLM <- not good
- Very subjective

### 10 Deep Fakes - Seeing is unbelieving
Interest: 4
Qualified: 1\~2
Feasibility: 1\~2

- Video Data Processing could be a worry
- Live Video !!!!
- System with video forensic tools

### 9 Unmasking Dark Patterns ~ Dylan's Project
Interest: 2\~3
Qualified: 4\~5
Feasibility: 4\~5

- A lot of room for growth
- Not really an experience though
- In the most basic form this could be a browser extension - anyone a JS expert?
- It could have some sort of magic behind it to analyse and find design patterns
- Could incorporate a game aspect where the user could try and discover the design patterns by themself - maybe experience?
- Stats tracking + visualisations to show many / common design patterns

### 8 Biosecurity Awareness
Interest: 2\~3
Qualified: 4
Feasibility: 4

- Could be gamified
- Also could have wearables involved somehow
- At least biosensor + real time
- Heavy papers please influence
- Could be reverse papers please - teaching people to not give too much information away
- Optional AR/VR

### 7 Remote Skill Transfer
Interest: 2
Qualified: 3
Feasibility: 3

- Could be quite difficult - virtually doing stuff
- Not really addressing a big problem - zoom is a thing
- Networking part 

### 5 What is Music
Interest: 3
Qualified: 3\~4 
Feasibility: 3\~4 

- Making more inclusive could be a challenge
- Physical Fabrication involved too
- Electronic tones??
> The instrument must have the ability to produce notes, no recorded music being played at the press of a button.
### 2 What's the rush
Interest: 4\~5
Qualified: 3
Feasibility: 1\~2

- Game engine
- Hardware involved
- Physical construction also involved
- Fair bit of work


# Final Choices and Justification

### 14.
Our team comes from a strong human-computer interaction background that we feel positions us very well to approach the ambient interface problem 
space in a compelling and effective way. The majority of our team are very experienced in conducting user research, user testing, and UX prototyping
according to design principles; as such, we believe that we are well equipped to ideate and design a solution to the Social Family project brief that 
is grounded in a strong understanding of the relevant user values and needs, and that we are capable of carrying out all necessary research to this 
end. Moreover, all of our team's members are proficient in multiple high-level programming languages (particularly Python and Java) and are 
knowledgeable about key data structures, algorithms, and design patterns to an extent that we feel will ensure we are prepared to handle the actual 
implementation of the project back-end and integration with any peripherals. We also have several members who bring data processing and visualisation 
skills that will serve us well as far as presenting users' calendar data in a way that facilitates enjoyable ambient interactions. Additionally, 
across the team we have a strong capacity to handle the high level of physical fabrication that we feel could be explored in this project, as well 
as proficiency with microcontrollers such that we feel incorporating Arduinos and other sensors in order to successfully realise these physical 
elements of the project should be entirely feasible for us. We therefore believe that we meet all required expected skills for this project brief 
and are confident that we will be able to deliver a solution that meets the success criteria.Finally, we are also unanimously interested in this 
project, with all team members having contributed several ideas for different calendar management options and ambient interface designs in even 
our earliest review of the brief; each of us feel extremely positive about the future ideation process that would come with this project and would
be very excited to see where implementing it takes us.


### 17.
We feel that as a team our skill set satisfy the expected skills for this project, and our mutual interests further set us up well to ideate
productively and expand innovatively on this project brief.  All members of the team have strong skills in high-level programming that we feel 
position each of us to capably handle implementing different features of the collaborative game. Several of us have some level of experience with
game engines and asset design, and those in the team who do not have prior experience have indicated that they are very interested in developing
these skills further, drawing on strong existing programming skills to do so. All of us are also at least capable at network programming, and
feel that between the six of us we will be able to support each other across developing further in this area and meeting the requirements of the
brief. Additionally, some members of the team are well-equipped to implement the AI component of the game, through prior familiarity with 
state-machine-based AI. Finally, we also feel that our broader background and experiences as a team align with this project, as we all have 
direct experience dealing with key health and safety concerns in retail, hospitality, or other workplace environments that gives us valuable 
insight into this problem space.


### 35.
Our team has a broad technical skillset that satisfies the full range of this project's expected skills, including the ability to process large 
datasets, familiarity across the full tech stack, and competency working with geolocated data. In particular, several of our team members have a 
high level of proficiency in various different forms of data science and visualisation that align well with the requirement for a physical interactive
display. In terms of the full tech stack, all of us are confident with back-end programming in Java and Python, and the majority of us are familiar
with JavaScript and React, and are inerested in building on these skills. We are also comfortable with geolocated data and proximity-triggered 
events, and feel we have the capacity as a team to develop these skills further as needed. Additionally, we feel that our strong human-computer
interaction background means we are well equipped to navigate the complex user needs at play in this problem space and conduct insightful user 
research and testing that ensures our solution will reflect inclusive and community-oriented social motivation strategies that facilitate emotional 
connection to a communal space.
