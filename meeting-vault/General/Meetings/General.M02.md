### Timeline graph review
https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMu12AoE=/
KEY:
- Aqua -> peripheral pieces (video, documentation, readme file)
- Yellow -> physical build (mostly Dylan)
- Blue -> Lambda board (input data capture) 
- Pink -> clock face display
- filled diamonds refer to assessment piece
- speech bubbles for whole team intensive meetings
	- should line up to calendar
- Not worried about sticking exactly to the Gantt chart, happy to adjust 
- Only include small image of chart, include link to active Miro board in caption
### Key Deliverables
- limit to diamond pieces on Gantt chart:
	- final cohesive project (all pieces together)
	- final codebase
	- kick-starter video
	- demo video
	- readme
	- finished input capture (lambda board) and backend (db)
	- finished clockface display
	- final physical build
	- research
	- documentation
- or limit to final piece of each Gantt stream?
	- less is more
	- use Gantt chart to expand on other deliverables
### Assumptions
- 4 person household
- Doesn't need to be server-based
	- will be using a laptop rather than a raspberry pi/arduino
### Responsibilities table
- split into key components
- Scrum Master Ali
- Make sure to mention in statement of work Ali is Project Manager/Scrum Master
LEADS:
- Scrum Master: Ali
- Graphics/Design: Maya
- Physical Build & Microcontroller: Dylan
- Input Data Capture (edge detection & webcam): Alex
- Assembly: Alex & Lucas
- Backend & Databases: David & Lucas
- User Research: Ali & Alex
- Market Research: Dylan & Lucas
- Kick-starter Video: David
##### GRAPHICS
- Tentative figma mockups
- Wait to select angular or react until screen is selected
	- screen could impact how the design is actually able to be implemented
- Keeping chatGPT-4 in mind
	- can upload a picture of our design and get assistance on implementation
### Features Outline
- features pulled from spec
	- ambient display, at a glance
	- multiple users
### Risks
- put in appendix
- is it for team or for users?
	- very vague
	- who knows? not us :)
- security concerns?
	- differential privacy
	- nothing will happen publicly anyway (all data handled locally)
### Create github issues
- kanban board of issues on git
- can put markdown list of tasks into git
- more effort than it is worth to open milestones or projects
- use the tags and labels instead
- leave week 6 presentation issue unassigned until more information around expectations are released
- use github roadmap to track all the todo's
### Review communication plan
- Expected response time during non-critical periods
	- expected same day response within business hours
	- else, next day response
- During critical periods increase availability (decrease response time)
	- respond within 12 hrs during agreed periods
- Create discord roles and channels
- Do we want to follow Agile?
	- sprints are a good idea but some aspects would be redundant
