# Lambda - Deco3801

# Hi Rosti ðŸª© Please read! 
We really wanted to have our READMEs finished for the snapshot so we could get your feedback on them but unfortunately we're all a bit slammed until the weekend and probably won't make it to them in time :( 
We'll just do our best to finish it up & maybe ping you a lot until next studio instead. Hope that's okay! And sorry for the lack of good docs in most places at the moment.
*Promise* they'll be shipshape for the real submission. 


1. top-level explanation of product
2. overview of github directory structure
3. guide to getting started â€” order to build in and links to longer readmes for each section 

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you have any issues building or running this project yourself, please feel free to make a new issue for the team to address. You can also reach out to the project lead (Ali) at a.laherty@uq.edu.au. 
!TODO did we need somebody to provide the password?

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
!TODO what do we put here? I know we have lots of ideas, but this has to be 1-page so what makes it in?

## Contributing
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
